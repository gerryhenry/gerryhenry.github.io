	<p>RAMONA is on a mission to free wine drinkers from rules, dinner tables, & bottle openers. Founder Jordan Salcito, one of the country's premier sommeliers, created RAMONA as an alter ego to her fine wine and high-end restaurant career. Obsessed with spritzes and inspired by wine coolers of the 1980s, Salcito noticed a distinct void in the market for a high quality, portable wine-based beverage that consumers could drink in traditional 'beer moments.' Named after her sister's mischievous childhood alter ego (she was a Beverly Cleary fan) RAMONA was born in September 2016.</p>
